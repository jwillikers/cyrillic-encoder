== Getting Started

This section describes how to set up the build environment required by the project.
These instructions are for Fedora 38.

. Install https://lix.systems[Lix].
+
[,sh]
----
curl -sSf -L https://install.lix.systems/lix | sh -s -- install
----

. First, clone the source code of this repository locally.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/cyrillic-encoder.git
----

. Then change into the project directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd cyrillic-encoder
----

. Run with `nix run`.
+
[,sh]
----
nix run
----

== Development

Everything can be built locally through Nix using the `nix develop` command.

To run the developer CMake workflow for the project, use the `dev` preset.

[,sh]
----
nix develop --command cmake --workflow --preset dev
----

. Enter a development shell with the `nix develop` command.
+
[,sh]
----
nix develop --command fish
----

. Use `just` to perform common tasks.
The `just workflow` command will run the CMake configure step, then build, and run the tests.
+
[,sh]
----
just workflow
----

. Exit the development shell with the `just exit` command.
+
[,sh]
----
exit
----

. Update the flake with the `nix flake update` or `just update` commands.
+
[,sh]
----
just update
----

// === Google Sanitizers

// Support for Google Sanitizers is provided by the https://github.com/StableCoder/cmake-scripts[cmake-scripts] project.
// Set the `USE_SANITIZER` CMake variable to an appropriate value as documented https://github.com/StableCoder/cmake-scripts#sanitizer-builds-sanitizerscmake[here].

// Use the Address and Undefined Behavior sanitizers like so.

// [,sh]
// ----
// bash -c '. build/RelWithDebInfo/generators/conanbuild.sh && cmake -DUSE_SANITIZER=Address;Undefined --preset conan-relwithdebinfo'
// ----

// == Format

// The https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html[clang-format] and https://cmake-format.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cmake-format.html[cmake-format] tools are used to format the source code files.
// The https://github.com/TheLartians/Format.cmake[Format.cmake] module provides build targets to simplify the use of these tools.

// Format the source files by building the CMake target `fix-format`.

// [,sh]
// ----
// bash -c '. build/RelWithDebInfo/generators/conanbuild.sh && cmake --build  --preset conan-relwithdebinfo --target fix-format'
// ----

== Todo

. Switch from CMake to Meson.
. Use Renovate to automatically update pre-commit hooks and eventually Conan when it is supported.
. Add support for building with Nix as an alternative package manager.
. Flatpak the application.
